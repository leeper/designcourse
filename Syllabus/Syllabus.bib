	This paper aims to clarify the meaning, and explain the utility, of
	the case study method, a methodoften practiced but little understood.
	A “case study,” I argue, is best de?ned as an intensive studyof a
	single unit with an aim to generalize across a larger set of units.
	Case studies rely on the
	
	
	same sort of covariational evidence utilized in non-case study research.
	Thus, the case study method is
	
	
	correctly understood as a particular way of de?ning cases, not a way
	of analyzing cases or a way of
	
	
	modeling causal relations. I show that this understanding of the subject
	illuminates some of the persistent
	
	
	ambiguities of case studywork, ambiguities that are, to some extent,
	intrinsic to the enterprise. The travails
	
	
	of the case study within the discipline of political science are also
	rooted in an insuf?cient appreciation of
	
	
	themethodological tradeoffs that thismethod calls forth. This paper
	presents the familiar contrast between
	
	
	case study and non-case study work as a series of characteristic strengths
	and weaknesses—af?nities—
	
	
	rather than as antagonistic approaches to the empirical world. In
	the end, the perceived hostility between
	
	
	case study and non-case study research is largely unjusti?ed and,
	perhaps, deserves to be regarded as a
	
	
	misconception. Indeed, the strongest conclusion to arise from this
	methodological examination concerns

  abstract = {When political scientists present empirical results, they are much
	more likely to use tables than graphs, despite the fact that graphs
	greatly increases the clarity of presentation and makes it easier
	for a reader to understand the data being used and to draw clear
	and correct inferences.Using a sample of leading journals, we document
	this tendency and suggest reasons why researchers prefer tables.
	We argue that the extra work required in producing graphs is rewarded
	by greatly enhanced presentation and communication of empirical results.We
	illustrate their benefits by turning several published tables into
	graphs, including tables that present descriptive data and regression
	results.We show that regression graphs emphasize point estimates
	and confidence intervals and that they can successfully present the
	results of regression models. A move away from tables towards graphs
	would improve the discipline’s communicative output and make empirical
	findings more accessible to every type of audience.},

	Nuclear Non-Use
	
	Nina Tannenwald
	
	
	We have recently witnessed the ? ftieth anniversary of the bombing
	of Hiroshima and
	
	Nagasaki, the only use of nuclear weapons in warfare. The non-use
	of nuclear weap-
	
	ons since then remains the single most important phenomenon of the
	nuclear age. Yet
	
	we still lack a full understanding of how this tradition arose and
	is maintained and of
	
	its prospects for the future. The widely cited explanation is deterrence,
	but this ac-
	
	count is either wrong or incomplete. Although an element of sheer
	luck no doubt has
	
	played a part in this fortuitous outcome, this article argues that
	a normative element
	
	must be taken into account in explaining why nuclear weapons have
	not been used
	
	since 1945. A normative prohibition on nuclear use has developed in
	the global
	
	system, which, although not (yet) a fully robust norm, has stigmatized
	nuclear weap-
	
	ons as unacceptable weapons of mass destruction. Without this normative
	stigma,
	
	there might have been more ‘‘use.’’1 This article examines this phenomenon
	in the
	
	context of the nuclear experience of the United States.
	
	
	This investigation is motivated by several empirical anomalies in
	the conventional
	
	account—deterrence—of the non-use of nuclear weapons since 1945. First
	is the
	
	non-use of nuclear weapons in cases where there was no fear of nuclear
	retaliation,
	
	that is, where the adversary could not retaliate in kind. This anomaly
	includes the ? rst
	
	ten years or so of the nuclear era, when the United States possessed
	? rst an absolute
	
	nuclear monopoly and then an overwhelming nuclear advantage over the
	Soviet Union.
	
	It also includes non-use by the United States in Vietnam (where the
	United States
	
	dropped tonnage equivalent to dozens of Hiroshima bombs) and in the
	1991 Persian
	
	
	For helpful comments and criticisms on presentations of this article,
	I am grateful to participants in
	
	seminars at Brown University, Harvard University, Yale University,
	Stanford University, and the Univer-

	Organization, and especially David
	
	Dessler, Lynn Eden, Scott Sagan, and Alexander Wendt.
	
	
	1. By ‘‘use’’ I mean dropping or launching nuclear weapons in all
	circumstances other than testing.
	
	States have obviously relied on nuclear weapons in other ways, including
	for deterrence, making threats,
	
	and alliance relations.

	Computer automation has a great deal of potential in this new media
	environment. The objective here is to outline and validate a new
	automated measurement instrument for sentiment analysis in political
	texts. Our instrument uses a dictionary-based approach consisting
	of a simple word count of the frequency of keywords in a text from
	a predefined dictionary. The design of the freely available Lexicoder
	Sentiment Dictionary (LSD) is discussed in detail here. The dictionary
	is tested against a body of human-coded news content, and the resulting
	codes are also compared to results from nine existing content-analytic
	dictionaries. Analyses suggest that the LSD produces results that
	are more systematically related to human coding than are results
	based on the other available dictionaries. The LSD is thus a useful
	starting point for a revived discussion about dictionary construction
	and validation in sentiment analysis for political communication.},
