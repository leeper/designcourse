\title{Causal Mechanisms and Process Tracing}

% Aside from knowing that one thing (X) caused another thing (Y), we often want to know how that causal process worked. This is the study of ``causal mechanisms''. How do we study causal mechanisms to gain a deeper understanding of causal relationships in politics? How do we study the process by which a causal effect plays out?

% when are we satisfied that we have ``bottomed out'' a mechanism?

% if concepts have many parts and we theorize that it is one part of that concept that transmits a causal effect, should we ever study causality at the level of concepts or should we only study causality at the level of the constitutive attribute that is thought to be causally relevant?

% at its most basic level, it answers ``what happened?'' (i.e., it is descriptive history)

% application of logic and ``counterfactual'' method
% update beliefs about counterfactuals in sequence

% inductive versus deductive approach
