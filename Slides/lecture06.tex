\title{Translating Texts into Interpretations and Numbers}

% Primary and secondary source documents provide a written record of politically relevant events and processes. Texts can be used in a number of ways in political science research. How do we draw meaning from texts in qualitative and quantitative ways? How does textual information become useful data for making political inferences?

Consider the following quote from a U.S. politician:

\begin{quote}
African Americans must stop making excuses and rely much more on themselves to get ahead in society.
\end{quote}

What does it mean? Is it positive or negative? Is it prejudicial?

\frametitle{Content Analysis Process}

\begin{enumerate}
\item<1-> Define a research question
\item<2-> Define concepts
\item<3-> Identify population (sample) of texts
\item<4-> Create a \textit{codebook} that describes how to operationalize concepts using text
\item<5-> Assign scores to text units based on codebook
\item<6-> Aggregate and summarize results
\end{enumerate}

}

% RQs and concepts are linked:
% what is the sentiment of this text?
% what is the ideology of this text?
% what ideas/arguments/frames/discourses are presented in this text?
% Tend to be descriptive RQs; causal inferences will come later once we've described the text fully
% content analysis is almost always comparative (comparing sources, authors, time period, contexts, etc.)

% what are the variables? what do we want to know about this text?

% scoring: ideology, positivity/negativity (both rely on word associations)
% dictionary methods (sentiment: lexicoder, ideology: wordfish)



\frame{

\frametitle{Example 1: Categorization}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
\item Common RQ relates to categorization:\\ What is this text saying?
\item Example RQs:

	\begin{itemize}
	\item What arguments are raised in this text?
	\item Are certain ideas more prevalent in some texts than others?
	\item How is an issue discussed in politics?
	\end{itemize}

\item<2-> Running ex.: UKIP's 2015 Manifesto
\end{itemize}
