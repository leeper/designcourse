\title{Causality: Explanation versus Prediction}

% Political science is generally concerned with questions of causality. To do that we need to learn to think counterfactually. How do we know that something causes something else? How do we separate ``correlation'' from ``causation''?

% constants can't be used to understand causality because we don't get to see counterfactuals

\frametitle{Causal Inference}

\centering

Causal inference (typically) involves gathering data in a systematic fashion in order to assess the size and form of correlation between nodes $X$ and $Y$ in such a way that there are no backdoor paths between $X$ and $Y$ by \textit{controlling for} (i.e., \textit{conditioning on}, \textit{holding constant}) any confounding variables, $\mathbf{Z}$.

}

In essence, this means finding or creating \textit{counterfactuals}.

\frametitle{Counterfactual Thinking}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1.5em
\item Causal inference involves inferring \textit{what would have happened} in a counterfactual reality \textit{where the potential cause took on a different value}

If two or more instances of the phenomenon under investigation have only one circumstance in common, the circumstance in which alone all the instances agree, is the cause (or effect) of the given phenomenon.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Difference}

If an instance in which the phenomenon under investigation occurs, and an instance in which it does not occur, have every circumstance save one in common, that one occurring only in the former; the circumstance in which alone the two instances differ, is the effect, or cause, or an necessary part of the cause, of the phenomenon.

\frame{
\frametitle{Agreement and Difference}

If two or more instances in which the phenomenon occurs have only one circumstance in common, while two or more instances in which it does not occur have nothing in common save the absence of that circumstance; the circumstance in which alone the two sets of instances differ, is the effect, or cause, or a necessary part of the cause, of the phenomenon.

\frametitle{Residue}

Subduct from any phenomenon such part as is known by previous inductions to be the effect of certain antecedents, and the residue of the phenomenon is the effect of the remaining antecedents.

\frametitle{Concomitant variations}

Whatever phenomenon varies in any manner whenever another phenomenon varies in some particular manner, is either a cause or an effect of that phenomenon, or is connected with it through some fact of causation.
