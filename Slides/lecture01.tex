% An overview of the course and an introduction to political science research. How do we identify research topics to study empirically? What makes for a good political science research questions?

\section{Substantive Material}

\frame{

\frametitle{Claims}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1em

\item Politics is full of claims

\item The credibility of claims depends on the strength of evidence and argument

\item This class aims to give you tools to:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1em
\item make credible claims, \textit{and}
\item evaluate claims made by others
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

}

\frametitle{An Example}

}

% is this true or false? ultimately, it doesn't really matter what we think a priori. we have to collect evidence





\frame{

\frametitle{Definitions}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep2em

\item Inference: ``a belief based on evidence \emph{and} rules for processing that evidence''

\item Methodology: ``tools for gathering and analyzing data to try to make valid inferences''

\frametitle{Question for you}

\Large How might be draw an inference about the effect of Brexit on economic competitiveness?

}

% minimum wage; unemployment?
% example
% time-series or historical analysis
% comparative analysis across countries or subnational units
% quasi-experimental comparison using a geographical discontinuity
% randomized experiment
% surveys to measure potential employees' willingness to work or employers' willingness to hire (or fire) new employees
% qualitative interviewing

% claims

\frametitle{Two Categories of Inference}

\begin{enumerate}\itemsep2em

\item Descriptive Inference

\begin{itemize}
\item What are the facts?
\end{itemize}

\item Causal Inference

\begin{itemize}
\item Why does something occur?
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

}

\frame{

\frametitle{Descriptive Inference}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em

\item Sometimes seen as the lesser type of inference

\item Still often very interesting

\item Examples

\begin{itemize}
\item Is the climate changing? 
\item Is the United States politically polarized? 
\item Is global terrorism increasing?
\item Is Azerbaijan a democracy?
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

}

\frame{

\frametitle{Causal Inference I}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em

\item Typically what we are interested in

\item Questions about ``why?''

\item Examples

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Why} is the climate changing? 
\item \emph{Why} is the United States politically polarized? 
\item \emph{Why} is (or is not) global terrorism increasing?
\item \emph{Why} is (or is not) Azerbaijan a democracy?
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

}
\frame{

\frametitle{Causal Inference II}

Typically start with either:

\begin{enumerate}\itemsep1em

\item an outcome (dependent variable)\\
\vspace{1em}
or

\item a cause (independent variable)

\end{enumerate}

}

\item Research question(s)
\item Clarify the core concepts % that we're talking about and how we will observe and measure
\item Develop (causal) theory
